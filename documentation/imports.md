# Imports documentation

### Abstract

The Import Tool is a feature designed to streamline the process of importing data from .tsv files into the system's database. It offers a user-friendly interface where users can upload their .tsv files via a web form. Upon submission, the system performs a series of validations to ensure the integrity and correctness of the provided data. If the validation process succeeds without any errors, the data is imported into the database, and a success message is returned to the user on the web page.
